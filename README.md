# Vanilla Plus Balanced Modpack

This modpack is designed to enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience through a balanced integration of quality-of-life improvements, performance optimizations, and immersive visual upgrades, while maintaining a core focus on gameplay balance.

Key systems and mechanics have been re-evaluated to provide a more refined and engaging survival experience:

- Villager mechanics have been significantly rebalanced. Breeding is disabled to reduce exploitability, Trade reset exploits removed ‚Äî breaking and replacing job sites no longer refreshes trades.
- `Waystones` are present to support structured travel; however, their crafting and destruction are disabled, and warp stones are removed from survival to avoid abuse, ensuring travel remains deliberate and world-interactive.
- Enchanting has been made easier and less tedious with simplified interfaces, consistent XP costs regardless of level, and the ability to extract enchantments from items to books using a grindstone.
- Minecarts now move faster by default, and powered rails have easier alternative recipes, making rail transport a practical and immersive early-game option.
- `Spyglass Improvements` replaces zoom mods with a fair, spyglass-based zoom, while `Spyglass Astronomy` adds immersive stargazing as a fun bonus.
- Antique Atlas 4 serves as the map mod of choice‚Äîhand-drawn style, balanced features, and highly vanilla-friendly.
- `Comforts` and `SleepWarp` improve sleep mechanics with sleeping bags, hammocks, and smoother transitions, reducing disruptions in multiplayer.
- Horses are faster, easier to control, and have improved behavior, making forest travel smoother and less frustrating.
- Mob spawns can be prevented more cleanly using a new high-tier torch, avoiding cluttered lighting setups.
- When you die, a grave stores your items and XP, allowing for safer and more reliable recovery.
- The End features reworked main islands for a more immersive and varied terrain, along with improved End Cities for richer exploration and elytra rewards.
- Fishing is more rewarding and engaging with new mechanics and 60+ fish to discover.
- Armor trims now grant effects, encouraging players to seek and use them for both style and gameplay benefits.
- Exposure adds a rich, vanilla-style film photography system with surprising depth.
- Horse-drawn carts enhance transportation and farming with a detailed, immersive cart system.
- Carts add an immersive system that improves both transportation and agriculture with flexible and functional utility.
- Various tweaks and quality-of-life improvements enhance gameplay, while biome and End upgrades stay true to the vanilla style.
